        <h3>Front-End</h3>
        <p>A niche of mine is Front-end Development. Building graphical interfaces,
          using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so users like yourself can view and interact with a site, such as this one. </p>

        <h3>Back-End</h3>
        <p>I am also into Back-end Development. There are so many levels of interactivity needed so that the sites you visit work as expected.
          Logging into an account or purchasing an item from an online store are all made possible via Back-end Development.</p>
